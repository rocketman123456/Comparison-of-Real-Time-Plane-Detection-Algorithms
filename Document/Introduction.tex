\label{chap:Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item planes are found everywhere in man-made environments.
    \item numerous applications integrate an automatic detection thereof into their system.
    \item therein, specific sensors give data representation of the environment, which is used to detect planes
    \item many of these systems have a temporal constraint which is often called real-time
    \item real-time plane detection is already possible, but good quality is often not affordable for the average consumer
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The question arises, to what extent real-time plane detection is possible under the usage of affordable hardware
    \item the intel realsense is such affordable hardware.
    \item the selection of the best algorithm requires a uniform comparison, though
    \item problem: the comparison of most algorithms is non-trivial, bc â€¦
    \item therefore, this work aims to achieve the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compare the current state of the art in the field of plane detection through quantitative analysis, and 
        \item find the best slam algorithm 
        \item with the additional constraints of real-time and OTS hardware, like the intel realsense.
    \end{itemize}  
\end{itemize}
